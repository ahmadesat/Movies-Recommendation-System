# Movies Recommendation System
A Machine Learning Code that recommends movies according to your movie ratings.
Based on Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Written in Python code using Jupyter Notebook


## How To Use:
1. Download MoviesRecommender.py

2. Download/Install all the required models used in the code (Using Anaconda3 interpreter can ease things up for you)


3.1. You can either use the already given data set "ml-100k.zip" (Retrieved from https://grouplens.org/) and extract it in the same folder as the python program (Easier choice)

*OR* 

3.2. Create a folder named "ml-100k". And put your own Dataset inside of it.

4. Change the value parameter of recommendMovies function to any user_id you want from the "u.data" file. 
(You can also add your own user_id ratings to the u.data file and use that id instead, I recommend that you use the user_id=0)

5. Run MoviesRecommender.py


Enjoy !
